This was a side project in which I used molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) transmission electron microscopy data from my work to identify the nanostructure of MoS2 using the FastAI dataloader and unet_learner classes.

I created segmentation mask images based on the tutorial here: https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-image-segmentation-masks-the-easy-way-dd4d3656dbd1
